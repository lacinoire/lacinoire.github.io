In October 2024 I had the pleasure to give a talk for the Quality and Testing Community at Bol ☀️.

During this talk I gave an overall introduction to test generation, which tools are available (mostly research ones...), and dive into two of our research projects: [Shaken, Not Stirred. How Developers Like Their Amplified Tests](https://carolin-brandt.de/works/brandt-tse24), where we investigate what developers change in automatically generated tests before adding them to their test suite by submitting tests to open source projects and analyzing the maintainer's feedback. And [Using GitHub Copilot for Test Generation in Python: An Empirical Study](https://carolin-brandt.de/works/elhaji-ast24) where we studied the usablity of unmodified GitHub Copilot to generate tests for Python projects.

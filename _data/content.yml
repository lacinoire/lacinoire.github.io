        <p>
          <strong>Hello! I‚Äôm Caro üê≥</strong>
          <br>I'm an Assistant Professor at the <a href=\"https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/\">Software Engineering Research Group</a> of <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/\">TU Delft</a>,
          where I lead the research line on <a href=\"https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/research-lines/human-and-developer-centered-se/\">Human- and Developer-centered Software Engineering</a>.
          My research focuses on embedding the future users of software and automation tools more closely and responsibly into the software development process.
          In my <a href=\"https://carolin-brandt.de/works/brandt-phd-thesis\">PhD</a> with my advisor <a href=\"https://azaidman.github.io/\">Andy Zaidman</a>, I investigated how to let automatic test amplification tools collaborate with developers
          to generate test cases that they can use to improve their test suites. üòä
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Wanna have a chat about research ideas or collaboration possibilities?</strong>
          <br>I'm looking to extend my network and work together with other researchers on embedding users into software development, automated tools supporting developers and other fun software engineering topics (there are too many to name! üòâ).<br>
          In working with me you can expect energetic initiative and clear structure, as well as a huge passion and focus on the developer's perspective and how our tools can actually be useful for their development reality. <br><br>
          If you are thinking about maybe working together or interested to ping-pong some ideas, shoot me an email!
